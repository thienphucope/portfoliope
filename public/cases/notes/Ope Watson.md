# Ope Watson

**Self-proclaimed Master of Procrastination**  
Loves staring at code like it might suddenly turn into anime. Currently training a neural network to fetch snacks but results are inconclusive.  

**Hobbies Include:**  
- Watching cartoons and anime… theoretically, when not buried under schoolwork.  
- Talking to AI like it’s a roommate who never judges your midnight snack choices.  
- Attempting to learn languages (English, Japanese) so they can confuse even more people on the internet.  
- Thinking deeply about life while pretending to be productive.  
- Imagining a world where TTS actually sounds like the person it’s cloning.  

**Special Skills:**  
- Can turn a Raspberry Pi into a “probably-somewhat-intelligent” assistant.  
- Expert in moving hands in front of sensors for no good reason (Leap Motion enthusiast).  
- Knows exactly how to overcomplicate a “simple” software project.  

**Life Motto:**  
*"Why do today what you can automate… or ignore until tomorrow?"*
