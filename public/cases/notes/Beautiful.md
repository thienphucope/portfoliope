# Beautiful

written by: no name

There’s nothing in this world more beautiful than love. People compare love to Music — sorrowful dark notes, crystal-clear bright ones, and sudden aching tones that fall slowly, drop by drop, then turn into a cold downpour. People compare love to painting — cheerful pastel hues, heavy muted tones, and glaring, heart-wrenching bursts of color. It’s no exaggeration when Ali 55 Leviticus, the younger brother of the philosopher Ali 44 Leviticus, and also a great poet of the 21st century, declared that love begins with noodles.

Ah, noodles. Long, soft, warm. They lie still in a bowl of broth, restless, eager, desperate to be taken into the mouth, caressed by a tongue, to dissolve and merge. They long for the moment they can warm the man from within, filling the empty spaces inside him, because they need him just as much as he needs them. Without him, their very existence becomes pointless — just days of stale waiting. Without them, his stomach would be growling right now, like a cursed alarm clock that won’t let anyone sleep in peace.

He stared blankly at the bowl, and at exactly 3:04 AM, his eyes stung a little. Tears threatened to spill, like any half-conscious human unsure if they were awake or dreaming. A thought flashed in his head like a divine revelation: Do I eat the noodles, or do the noodles eat me? Sure, to chefs, restaurants, and his entire family, that question sounded absurd. Noodles are cooked to be eaten — what else? But if he got to philosophize with his idol Ali Leviticus, the answer would be very different.

Yes, noodles are meant to be eaten. But aren’t they consuming him too? Don’t they crave something inside him as well? Deep down, in that stomach, he remembers a bowl he ate four hours ago. It was delicious to the point of tears. The noodles weren’t too chewy nor mushy, the broth rich but not salty, like finding a long-lost soulmate in the chaos of life.

Every sip of broth, every lift of noodles felt like tender affection — hand-holding, whispered sweet nothings, a hug from behind on a first date. Warmth spread not just on his tongue but across his face, through his entire body. Before he realized it, the noodles had pinned him to the metaphorical ground, wrapped his wrists, and satisfied both him and themselves with all they had — flavor, broth, love — that soft, warm love slipping deep inside him, and the choked moans of delight trying not to escape.
“Keep quiet,” the bowl whispered.
“For you and I are lovers stealing a night together.”

He held the bowl tight. He only wanted more. No one can escape such seduction.
But… did the noodles feel the same?

Alas. He hadn’t even eaten much when the bowl was already empty. A fleeting romance, gone like strangers brushing past each other in a crowd.
But wait — wasn’t there still another full bowl right there?

They stared at each other.
A moment later, the noodles spoke:
“Let me enter you properly.”

He swallowed, picked up his chopsticks, and tasted a bite. His instincts screamed something was wrong, but he ignored them.

And then — betrayal.

This was not the Soulmate Noodle he loved earlier.
Though both came from the same pot, this one was no lover.
It was an ancient enemy.

Its name was Noodle. Surname Truong. Truong Thi Noodle.
Or in a Westernized way: Noodle Truong.
He cursed.
He had completely forgotten the pot was cooked at 11 PM, and also forgot the warning: Never cook more than you can eat.

Now he wasn’t eating noodles. He was eating garbage.
And he hated garbage.

Every bite brought tears not of joy but of grief for his doomed stomach and wounded tongue. Normally, he’d just throw it away. But throwing away secret midnight noodles? He’d be yelled at to death.

So he gritted his teeth and endured, letting Noodle Truong crawl into him, caress and invade places he would never willingly allow. He tried to imagine the beauty of the earlier bowl, but it was impossible — because this tasted worse than edible rice straws.

He was like a man fantasizing about a mistress while being stuck in bed with his awful spouse. The spouse demanded full attention, wrapped around him like a bear mauling its prey.
He was going to die. He would die. This was too much.

But slowly… he got used to it.
Like Mị in The Story of A Phởn Wife, whose soul had long died after years of suffering — he convinced himself this was fine. As long as the stomach stays quiet, anything is fine.

The moment he thought of “quiet,” his throat burned.
He sprinted to the bathroom.

Everything he had just eaten erupted violently out of him and into the toilet.

And so, another sleepless night of hunger awaited.
